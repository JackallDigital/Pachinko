# Pachinko

This Pachinko game was made completely in Unity. The point of the game was to implement counters and to reset those counters when the player plays another round.

On each round 100 balls spawn with a bit of delay. There are 3 different balls (size, colour, point value).

Boxes below count how many of each ball (Small, Medium, Large) fell into them and they display the total score of those balls.

Player wins if an individual box has 100 points, or if the total combined points are greater than 500.
